# Realtime_Currency_Exchange_Rates_To_CSV
This project allows you to fetch real-time currency exchange rates from an API and save the data in a CSV file. The exchange rates are retrieved from the **apilayer.net** API, and the data is processed and written into a CSV file. This can be used for business intelligence reporting or any system that requires real-time currency rate information
